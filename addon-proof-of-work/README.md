If your challenge requires Proof of Work just call this file before running the
challenge: `python pow.py` and exit in case of a non-zero return code.

Please provide a good way of deploying your challenge locally so players don't
need to solve that many proofs of work.

## Difficulty

The proof of work difficulty was adjusted for GlacierCTF2023 by Hannes.

Feel free to adjust it, but take into consideration that it could be tedious to
play the challenge on a not-so-powerful PC.

## License

This was yoinked by Hannes, then yoinked by Ernesto. AFAIK Hannes checked the
license was permissive.
