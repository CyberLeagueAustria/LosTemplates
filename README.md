# Template Guidelines

Challenge templates for CTFs as you go! Sane defaults, simplified complexity,
automated workflows, integrated sanity checking, and deployable everywhere.

Just copy any folder you'd like to your CTF repository to start with.

## Dependencies

### Deployment

Install `docker`, `bash`, `make`, GNU `envsubst`, GNU `tar`, GNU `coreutils` and `parallel`.

All templates have been tested on Fedora 40 and default Ubuntu 24.04 with podman and docker.

### Players via dist `.tar.gz`

Install `docker`, `tar` and a linux shell.
